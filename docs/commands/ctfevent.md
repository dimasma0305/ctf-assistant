# CTFEvent Commands Reference

Complete reference for CTF event-specific role management commands.

## Command Overview

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `/ctfevent role` | Everyone | Create challenge author role assignment message |
| `/ctfevent rebind` | Everyone | Rebind reaction role listeners to existing message |

## Overview

The CTFEvent system provides role management specifically for internal TCP1P CTF events. These commands help assign roles to challenge authors and manage role-based permissions for event organization.

**Note**: These commands are designed for **organizing your own CTF events**, not participating in external CTFs.

## Commands

### `/ctfevent role`

Create a role assignment message for CTF challenge authors to claim their categories.

### `/ctfevent rebind <id>`

Rebind reaction role listeners to an existing role assignment message.

```
/ctfevent rebind id:<message_id>

```

**What it does:**
1. Fetches the specified message
2. Re-assigns all users who previously reacted
3. Reattaches event listeners for future reactions
4. Ensures role assignment system works again
5. Processes existing reactions

**Use Cases:**
- Fix broken role assignment after bot restart
- Restore role system without recreating message
- Repair event listeners after updates
- Maintain existing reaction history

**Important Notes:**
- Must be used in the same channel as the message
- Message must exist and be accessible
- Re-processes all existing reactions
- Useful after bot downtime or restarts
- Does not create new message

**Getting Message ID:**
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings

**Response Format:**
```
(Command deletes its own reply after execution)
```

## Permission Roles

### Everyone
- Can use both commands
- Can create role assignment messages
- Can rebind existing messages
- Democratic system for role management

### Bot Requirements
- Needs `Manage Roles` to assign/remove roles
- Bot role must be higher than assigned roles in hierarchy
- Needs `Add Reactions` for reaction-based system
- Needs `Read Message History` for rebind function

---

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up Internal CTF Event

1. **Create event channels** for each category:
   - `#web-challenges`
   - `#crypto-challenges`
   - `#pwn-challenges`
   - etc.

2. **Post role assignment** in announcement channel:
   ```
   /ctfevent role
   ```

3. **Challenge authors react** to claim their categories

4. **Grant channel permissions** based on roles

### Fixing Role Assignment After Bot Restart

1. **Find role assignment message** in channel

2. **Copy message ID**:
   - Right-click message
   - "Copy ID"

3. **Rebind role listeners**:
   ```
   /ctfevent rebind id:1234567890123456789
   ```

4. **Verify** by testing reactions

## Troubleshooting

### Roles Not Being Assigned
- Check bot has `Manage Roles` permission
- Verify bot role is higher than assigned roles
- Ensure bot hasn't been restarted (use rebind if needed)
- Check role permissions in server settings

### Rebind Command Not Working
- Verify message ID is correct
- Ensure message is in the current channel
- Check bot can access the message
- Message must be from the bot itself

### Cannot Find Message ID
- Enable Developer Mode in Discord
- User Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Developer Mode
- Right-click message ‚Üí Copy ID
- Must be a message, not a channel or user ID

### Wrong Roles Being Assigned
- Reaction emojis must match configured mapping
- Check role names match expected categories
- Verify no conflicting role assignment bots
- Review role configuration in code

---

## Best Practices

1. **Post in Dedicated Channel**:
   - Use announcement or role channel
   - Pin the role assignment message
   - Keep channel clean (only role message)

2. **Test Before Event**:
   - Test with personal account
   - Verify all category roles work
   - Check permission inheritance

3. **Rebind After Bot Updates**:
   - Run rebind after bot restart
   - Verify role system after deployments
   - Keep message ID documented

4. **Clear Role Names**:
   - Use descriptive role names
   - Match challenge categories exactly
   - Consistent naming across channels

5. **Document for Team**:
   - Explain role system to authors
   - Share instructions for claiming roles
   - Include in event welcome messages

---

## Technical Details

### Reaction-Role Mapping

The system maps emoji reactions to Discord roles:

```
üåê ‚Üí Web Role
üîê ‚Üí Crypto Role
üíæ ‚Üí Pwn Role
üîç ‚Üí Reverse Engineering Role
üî¨ ‚Üí Forensics Role
‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí Misc Role
```

### Event Listeners

The bot maintains event listeners that:
- Detect when users add reactions
- Assign corresponding roles immediately
- Detect when users remove reactions
- Remove corresponding roles

### Persistence

- Event listeners are in-memory
- Lost on bot restart (requires rebind)
- Message and reactions persist in Discord
- Role assignments remain even if bot offline
