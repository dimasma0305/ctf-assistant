## Commands

### `/solve init [fetch_command] [json_file]`

Initialize CTF challenges from platform JSON data, creating threads for organization.

**Syntax:**
```
/solve init [fetch_command:<string>] [json_file:<attachment>]
```

**Parameters:**
- `fetch_command` (optional): JavaScript fetch command for auto-updates
  - Type: String
  - Purpose: Enables automatic challenge list refresh every 5 minutes
  - Format: Valid JavaScript fetch() code returning challenge JSON
- `json_file` (optional): JSON file containing challenge data
  - Type: File attachment (.json or .txt)
  - Alternative to manual modal input
  - Faster for large challenge sets

**Required Permissions:**
- User: Standard member
- Bot: `Create Public Threads`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`

**Examples:**
```
# Initialize with file upload
/solve init json_file:challenges.json

# Initialize with auto-update fetch command
/solve init fetch_command:fetch('https://ctf.example.com/api/challenges').then(r=>r.json())

# Initialize with both (file takes priority)
/solve init json_file:challs.json fetch_command:fetch('https://api.example.com/challs')

# Initialize with modal (no parameters)
/solve init
```

**What it does:**
1. Accepts challenge data via three methods (priority order):
   - Uploaded JSON file
   - Fetch command execution
   - Manual modal input
2. Parses and validates JSON structure
3. Creates a thread for each challenge with format: `‚ùå [Category] ChallengeName`
4. Stores challenge metadata in database
5. If fetch command provided, saves it for automatic 5-minute updates
6. Marks all challenges as unsolved initially

**Expected JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "challenges": [
    {
      "name": "EasyPwn",
      "category": "Pwn",
      "points": 100,
      "description": "Buffer overflow challenge",
      "solved": false
    },
    {
      "name": "CryptoBasic",
      "category": "Crypto",
      "points": 150,
      "description": "RSA challenge"
    }
  ]
}
```

Or flat array:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "WebExploit",
    "category": "Web",
    "points": 200
  }
]
```

**Supported Platforms:**
- CTFd (standard format)
- rCTF
- CTFx
- Custom platforms (with compatible JSON)

**Use Cases:**
- Start a new CTF with automated challenge tracking
- Import challenges from CTF platform at event start
- Enable auto-sync for platforms with APIs
- Organize team collaboration with per-challenge threads

**Important Notes:**
- Must be run in a CTF event channel (configured via `/ctftime schedule`)
- Creates one thread per challenge in the current channel
- Fetch command runs every 5 minutes if provided
- JSON validation errors will show specific format issues
- Existing challenges are updated, not duplicated
- Auto-update only fetches new challenges, doesn't delete removed ones

**Fetch Command Tips:**
```javascript
// CTFd API
fetch('https://ctf.example.com/api/v1/challenges', {
  headers: {'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_TOKEN'}
}).then(r=>r.json())

// Public API
fetch('https://api.ctf.example.com/challenges').then(r=>r.json())

// With error handling
fetch('https://ctf.example.com/challs').then(r=>r.json()).catch(e=>null)
```

**Response Format:**
```
‚úÖ Successfully initialized 45 challenges!

Created threads:
‚ùå [Web] SQLi Basics
‚ùå [Pwn] Buffer Overflow 101
‚ùå [Crypto] RSA Challenge
... (and 42 more)

üîÑ Auto-update enabled: Challenges will refresh every 5 minutes
```

```

**Parameters:**
None

**Required Permissions:**
- User: Standard member
- Bot: `Create Public Threads`, `Send Messages`

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New CTF

1. **Schedule the CTF**:
   ```
   /ctftime schedule id:2584
   ```

2. **Initialize challenges**:
   ```
   /solve init json_file:challenges.json
   ```
   Or with auto-sync:
   ```
   /solve init fetch_command:fetch('https://ctf.example.com/api/challenges').then(r=>r.json())
   ```

3. **Verify setup**:
   ```
   /solve list
   ```

4. **Create leaderboard**:
   ```
   /solve leaderboard global:false auto_update:true
   ```

### During a CTF

1. **Work on challenges** in respective threads
2. **Mark solves** when completed:
   ```
   /solve challenge players:@solver1 @solver2
   ```
3. **Check progress**:
   ```
   /solve list
   ```
4. **View standings**:
   ```
   /solve leaderboard global:false
   ```

### After a CTF

1. **Review final standings**:
   ```
   /solve leaderboard global:false limit:25
   ```
2. **Archive the CTF**:
   ```
   /ctftime archive id:2584
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Initialize Challenges
- Verify JSON format matches expected structure
- Check that you're in a valid CTF event channel
- Ensure bot has permission to create threads
- Try with smaller JSON file to test
- Validate JSON syntax using online validator

### Challenge Not Marked as Solved
- Must be in the challenge's thread
- Thread name must follow format: `‚ùå [Category] Name`
- Check bot has `Manage Threads` permission
- Verify you're mentioning users correctly with `@`

### Leaderboard Shows Wrong Scores
- Scores are calculated from all solve records
- Collaborative solves split points
- Check `/solve list` to verify solve attributions
- Scores update in real-time, refresh may be cached

### Auto-Update Not Working
- Verify fetch command was provided during init
- Check fetch command returns valid JSON
- Test fetch command in browser console first
- Review bot console logs for errors
- Ensure platform API is accessible

### Threads Not Created
- Bot needs `Create Public Threads` permission
- Channel must allow thread creation
- Check channel isn't at thread limit
- Verify bot role has necessary permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Challenge Names**: 
   - Include category in thread name
   - Keep names concise but clear
   - Follow consistent naming convention

2. **Attribution is Important**:
   - Always mention all contributors
   - Give credit where due
   - Update solve if you forgot someone

3. **Organize by Category**:
   - JSON should include accurate categories
   - Helps with progress tracking
   - Makes `/solve list` more readable

4. **Enable Auto-Update for Long CTFs**:
   - Especially useful for multi-day events
   - Reduces manual work
   - Catches new challenges immediately

5. **Use Threads Effectively**:
   - Discuss solutions in respective threads
   - Share hints and progress
   - Keep main channel clean

6. **Regular Leaderboard Updates**:
   - Post leaderboard periodically
   - Motivates team participation
   - Tracks individual contributions

7. **Clean Data Entry**:
   - Double-check JSON format
   - Test with small subset first
   - Validate before importing large lists

## JSON Import Examples

### CTFd Export
```json
{
  "challenges": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Welcome",
      "category": "Misc",
      "value": 10,
      "description": "Welcome challenge",
      "solves": 150
    }
  ]
}
```

### rCTF Export
```json
[
  {
    "name": "sanity-check",
    "category": "misc",
    "points": 1,
    "description": "Welcome to the CTF!"
  }
]
```

### Custom Format
```json
{
  "challenges": [
    {
      "title": "EasyCrypto",
      "cat": "Cryptography",
      "pts": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: The bot attempts to parse various formats. Ensure your JSON includes at minimum: `name` and `category` fields.
