## Common Workflows

### Checking Bot Status

**Simple check**:
```
/ping
```

**If no response:**
1. Check bot is online (green dot)
2. Verify bot permissions
3. Check Discord API status
4. Contact bot administrator

### Posting Recruitment Message

**Basic recruitment** (when fully implemented):
```
/mencari mencari
```

**Expected flow:**
1. Command opens modal or form
2. Fill in team details
3. Submit recruitment post
4. Post appears in channel
5. Users can respond

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding to `/ping`
- Check bot online status
- Verify bot has channel access
- Check Discord API status
- Restart bot if necessary
- Contact administrator

### Cannot Use `/mencari`
- Verify you have both `Manage Roles` and `Manage Channels`
- Check role hierarchy
- Confirm permissions in specific channel
- Contact server administrator

### Administrative Commands Not Available
- Verify you have administrator role
- Commands may be hidden if not authorized
- Check with server owner
- May require special role assignment

## Best Practices

1. **Use `/ping` for Quick Checks**:
   - Fast way to verify bot status
   - No side effects
   - Always safe to use

2. **Don't Spam Commands**:
   - Respect rate limits
   - One ping is enough
   - Wait for response

3. **Administrative Commands**:
   - Use responsibly
   - Document usage
   - Follow server policies
   - Log important actions

4. **Report Issues**:
   - If `/ping` fails, report to admins
   - Document error messages
   - Note time and context
   - Help debug problems

## Technical Details

### Latency Measurement

While `/ping` doesn't currently show latency, typical measurements include:
- **Command Processing**: Time from command to response
- **API Latency**: Discord API response time
- **Bot Latency**: Internal processing delay

**Good latency**: <100ms
**Acceptable**: 100-500ms
**Slow**: >500ms

### Command Registration

Utility commands are registered as slash commands with Discord's API. They appear in the command menu when typing `/`.

### Permissions Model

Commands use Discord's permission system:
- **Public**: Everyone can use
- **Moderation**: Require specific permissions
- **Administrative**: Require admin role
