- Typically assigned to team administrators

### Gas Mabar

- Cannot modify registrations
- Suitable for team coordinators

### Everyone

---

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up Notification System

1. **Create dedicated channels**:
   - `#ctf-announcements` for CTF schedules
   - `#weekly-reminders` for Friday updates
   - `#solves` for challenge completions

2. **Register channels**:
   ```
   /notify register channel:#ctf-announcements event_type:ctf_announcement
   /notify register channel:#weekly-reminders event_type:weekly_reminder
   /notify register channel:#solves event_type:solve_update
   ```

3. **Verify setup**:
   ```
   /notify list
   ```

4. **Test notifications**:
   - Wait for next Friday for weekly reminders
   - Schedule a test CTF for announcement test
   - Mark a challenge solved for solve update test

### Updating Notification Preferences

To add more notification types to an existing channel:
```
# Channel already registered for weekly_reminder
# Add ctf_announcement without losing weekly_reminder
/notify register channel:#feed event_type:ctf_announcement
```

The bot will merge the event types automatically.

### Reorganizing Notification Channels

1. **Unregister old channels**:
   ```
   /notify unregister channel:#old-announcements
   /notify unregister channel:#old-feed
   ```

2. **Register new channels**:
   ```
   /notify register channel:#new-ctf-hub event_type:all
   ```

3. **Verify changes**:
   ```
   /notify list
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Error
- Verify you have `Mabar Manager` role
- Check role hierarchy (your role should be properly assigned)
- Contact server administrator for role assignment

### Notifications Not Received
1. **Check registration status**:
   ```
   /notify list
   ```
2. **Verify channel is active** (‚úÖ Active status)
3. **Check event type subscription** matches the expected notification
4. **Ensure bot has permissions** in the channel:
   - View Channel
   - Send Messages
   - Embed Links
5. **Wait for next scheduled time** (weekly reminders only send on Fridays)

### Channel Shows as "deleted"
- Channel was deleted from Discord but registration remains
- Unregister the deleted channel to clean up:
  ```
  /notify unregister channel:#deleted-channel-name
  ```

### Cannot Register Channel
- Ensure you're selecting a **text channel**, not voice/category/forum
- Check bot has access to view and send messages in the channel
- Verify channel exists and you have permission to access it

### Duplicate Notifications
- Channel may be registered multiple times with overlapping event types
- Review with `/notify list`
- Unregister and re-register with correct event types

---

## Best Practices

1. **Separate Channels by Purpose**: 
   - Don't mix all notifications in one channel
   - Use dedicated channels for different notification types
   - Makes it easier for team members to follow relevant updates

2. **Use Descriptive Channel Names**:
   - `#ctf-announcements` instead of `#general`
   - `#weekly-ctf-reminders` instead of `#reminders`
   - Clear names help team understand channel purpose

3. **Register with Specific Event Types**:
   - Avoid using `event_type:all` unless you want a complete feed
   - Targeted notifications reduce noise
   - Team members can subscribe to channels matching their interests

4. **Regular Audits**:
   - Run `/notify list` monthly to review configurations
   - Clean up inactive or deleted channels
   - Update registrations as team needs change

5. **Document Your Setup**:
   - Keep notes on which channels receive what notifications
   - Share notification schedule with team
   - Include notification info in channel topics/descriptions

6. **Test Before Going Live**:
   - Register a test channel first
   - Verify notifications arrive as expected
   - Adjust event types based on team feedback

7. **Timezone Awareness**:
   - Weekly reminders are sent at 8 AM SGT
   - Convert to your team's timezone for planning
   - Consider team members in different timezones
